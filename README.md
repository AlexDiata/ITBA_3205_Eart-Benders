# Landslide-risk-reduction-framework


### Introduction

The upward trend in high-intensity rainfall events, growing population, expansion of plantation, and lifelines increased the landslide risk of the country. Though developed countries adopted in risk assessment-based management, conversely, they rely on conventional landslide hazard assessment-based risk management. Therefore, this study is attempted to create a standardized landslide risk assessment framework, combining susceptibility and vulnerability. In the experimental design, landslide susceptibility was determined by landslide causative factors, and assessed for landslide vulnerability.  Landslides disrupt livelihoods, cause loss of human lives and damages to property and infrastructure. the destructive impact of landslides has been steadily increasing as a result of the rising occupation of marginal land and extreme weather events caused by climate change. In particular, the impacts of seasonal, shallow landslides have been underestimated due to underreporting, and lack appropriate policy response.
Within this paper, we argue that citizen science the practice of incorporating the general public in the process of knowledge co-production may help address this issue by increasing the knowledge base of stakeholders at different levels. The aim of the project is to innovate participatory environmental monitoring and to generate evidence to support resilience. Our exploratory qualitative investigation outlines the strategies currently employed by the local communities that continue living in the landslide affected areas. These include demographic shifts and patterns, land use changes and occupational diversification.

### Problem Statement
* What factors influence the occurrence of a landslide?
* What policies should be implemented to mitigate the damaging effects that a landslide can have?
* What effects does a landslide have in terms of:
 1.1. Loss of life
 1.2. destruction of infrastructure
 1.3. damage to land and loss of natural resources



### Significance of the proposed project
This research will assist individuals and society by allowing them to discover a solution and prevent disaster. This initiative allows the community to gather information and will assist them in gaining more awareness about our present emergency scenario. To the NDRRMC (National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council) and the Government. This project allows for the collection of important information that benefits a large number of citizens, as well as the provision of various forms of support for the program and the strengthening of the catastrophe risk reduction scenario. 
To the future researchers. The synthesis of data and analysis may be used to gain a better knowledge of the situation. This study will act as a guide and source of support for future research. The research will provide them with a solid basis and overview of the Landslide Risk Reduction-analyses Framework's and impacts.

### Methods (kind of analysis na gagawin)
### Expected output
1. For the people in the areas should be aware to landslide especially on those areas that are prone to landslide.
2. To remind the people to follow the policies on how to decrease the effects of landslide and avoid mining or any activities in the area that can cause landslide.
3. In the area that are prone to landslide to be aware of landslide and learn about the emergency response and evacuation plans in your area.
