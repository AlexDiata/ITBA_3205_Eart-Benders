# Landslide Risk Reduction Framework: Exploratory Data Analysis on Landslide Risks in the Philippines


### Introduction

 The country's landslide risk has increased due to an increase in high-intensity rainfall event. In contrast to developed countries, which have adopted risk assessment-based management, developing countries still rely on traditional landslide hazard assessment-based risk management. As a result, the goal of this research is to develop a standardized landslide risk assessment framework that considers both susceptibility and vulnerability. Landslide susceptibility was determined by landslide causative factors, and landslide vulnerability was assessed in the experimental design. Landslides disrupt livelihoods, result in human deaths, and cause property and infrastructure damage. As a result of the rising occupation of marginal land and extreme weather events caused by climate change, the destructive impact of landslides has been steadily increasing. Seasonal, shallow landslides, in particular, have had their impacts understated due to underreporting and a lack of appropriate policy responses.
 
We claim in this paper that citizen science, or involving the general public in the process of knowledge co-production, can help address this problem by expanding the knowledge base of stakeholders at various levels. The project's goal is to create evidence to support resilience by innovating participatory environmental monitoring. Our exploratory qualitative study outlines the current strategies used by local communities who are still living in landslide-affected areas. These include changes in demographics and patterns, changes in land use, and occupational diversification.
### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
#### 11-5 Reduce the Adverse Effects of Natural Disasters

By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations.

#### 13 CLIMATE CHANGE

Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters; integrate climate change measures into policies and planning; build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change.

#### 15 LIFE ON LAND

Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss

### Problem Statement
* What factors influence the occurrence of a landslide?
* What policies should be implemented to mitigate the damaging effects that a landslide can have?



### Significance of the proposed project
 This research will assist individuals and society by allowing them to discover a solution and prevent disaster. This initiative allows the community to gather information and will assist them in gaining more awareness about our present emergency scenario. To the NDRRMC (National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council) and the Government. This project allows for the collection of important information that benefits a large number of citizens, as well as the provision of various forms of support for the program and the strengthening of the catastrophe risk reduction scenario. 
To the future researchers. The synthesis of data and analysis may be used to gain a better knowledge of the situation. This study will act as a guide and source of support for future research. The research will provide them with a solid basis and overview of the Landslide Risk Reduction-analyses Framework's and impacts.

### Methods 
 The inadequacy of a risk-reduction framework across the Philippine archipelago's cities and municipalities is the project's main focus. This was a crucial component that could have long-term impacts for all Filipinos. To resolve this, the researchers will use an exploratory analysis approach on the data sets chosen for this study. After the data has been analyzed, the exploratory analysis will help the researchers identify connections and develop ideas and solutions to the Philippines' lack of landslide risk reduction frameworks.

### Expected output
1. For the people in the areas should be aware to landslide especially on those areas that are prone to landslide.
2. To remind the people to follow the policies on how to decrease the effects of landslide and avoid mining or any activities in the area that can cause landslide.
3. In the area that are prone to landslide to be aware of landslide and learn about the emergency response and evacuation plans in your area.
